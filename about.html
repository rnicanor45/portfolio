      <h3>Hi! I'm Ryan, a Product/UX Designer from the San Francisco Bay Area.</h3>
      <br><br>
      <p>I majored in Cognitive Science with a specialization in Human-Computer Interaction
        at the University of California, San Diego. It was here that I gained my appreciation for 
        Human-Centered Design and Design Thinking. I currently work for XOLV Technology Solutions, 
        leading their design initiatives through the practice of Lean UX. I as a "design evangelist"
        for the company, representing the voice of the user and pushing for a user-centric approach
        to product design. Outside of UI design, prototyping, and user research, I facilitate
        cross-department design studios and business stakeholder meetings. I have taken both consumer and enterprise
        products from concept to release on mobile and desktop platforms.
